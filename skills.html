        <h2>Skill Showcase</h2>
        <p>One skill I'd like to teach you is Rubriks Cubing. It's a fascinating skill that I've enjoyed learning and practicing. 
            1. White cross
Let's begin with the white face. First we have to make a white cross paying attention to the color of the side center pieces. You can try to do this without reading the instructions.

 This step is relatively intuitive because there are no solved pieces to watch out for. Just practice and don't give up easily. Try move the white edges to their places not messing up the ones already fixed.

2. White corners

In this step we have to arrange the white corner pieces to finish the first face. If you are very persistent and you managed to do the white cross without help then you can try to do this one as well. If you don't have patience I'll give you some clue.

Twist the bottom layer so that one of the white corners is directly under the spot where it's supposed to go on the top layer. Now, do one of the three algorithms according to the orientation of the piece, aka. in which direction the white sticker is facing. If the white corner piece is where it belongs but turned wrong then first you have to pop it out.

3. Second layer
Until this point the procedure was pretty straight forward but from now on we have to use algorithms. We can forget the completed white face so let's turn the cube upside down to focus on the unsolved side.

In this step we are completing the first two layers (F2L). There are two symmetric algorithms we have to use in this step. They're called the Right and Left algorithms. These algorithms insert the Up-Front edge piece from the top layer to the middle layer while not messing up the solved white face.
If none of the pieces in the top layer are already lined up like in the images below, then turn the top layer until one of the edge pieces in the top layer matches one of the images below. Then follow the matching algorithm for that orientation.

Left:
U'L'ULUFU'F'
U' L' U L U F U' F'

Right:
URU'R'U'F'UF
U R U' R' U' F' U F


If an edge piece is on its place in the second layer orienting wrong then we have to apply the algorithm twice. First we must pop it out inserting another one in its place.


4. Yellow cross
Start solving the last layer making a yellow cross on the top of the cube. It doesn't matter if the pieces are not on their final places so we don't have to pay attention to the colors of the sides.

We can get three possible patterns on the top. Use this algorithm to go from one state to the other:
FRUR'U'F'

When you see a dot you have to apply the algorithm three times. If you have a yellow "L" shape then onlye twice, holding the cube in your hands as seen on the image below.
In case of a horizontal line you just have to execute the permutation once.

5. Yellow edges
After making the yellow cross on the top of the cube you have to put the yellow edge pieces on their final places to match the colors of the side center pieces. Switch the front and left yellow edges with the following algorithm:

RUR'URU2R'U
You might face a situation when you have to apply this algorithm more than once.

6. Yellow corners on their places
Only the last layer corners are left unsolved. First we have to get them to the right spot, so don't worry about the orientation in this step.

Find a piece which is already on the right place, move it to the right-front-top corner then apply the following algorithm to switch (cycle) the three wrong pieces marked on the image.

URU'L'UR'U'L

Do this twice to do an inverse rotation of the pieces. If none of the yellow corners is on the right place then execute the algorithm once to get a good piece.

7. Orient Yellow Corners
All pieces are on their right places you just have to orient the yellow corners to finish the puzzle. This proved to be the most confusing step so read the instructions and follow the steps carefully.

Hold the cube in your hand with an unsolved corner on the front-right-top corner, then do the algorithm below twice or four times until that specific piece is oriented well:
R'D'RD

It will look like you've messed up the whole cube but don't worry, it will be all right when all the corner pieces are oriented.

Turn the top layer only to move another unsolved yellow piece to the front-right-top corner of the cube and do the same R' D' R D again until this specific piece is ok. Be careful not to move the two bottom layers between the algorithms and never rotate the whole cube!

You are so close to the end so be careful because this is the step in this tutorial where most people get lost. If this description doesn't make sense, check out a few examples clicking here.

Repeat this until your Cube is solved :)
